  <h2 style="color:blue;font-size:40px;">Know  MORE About Ducati </h2>
  <p><strong>Ducati is best known for high-performance motorcycles characterized by large-capacity four-stroke, 90° V-twin engines,
  with a desmodromic valve design. Ducati branded his configuration as L-twin because one cylinder is vertical while the other is horizontal,
  making it look like a letter "L". Ducati's desmodromic valve design is nearing its 50th year of use. Desmodromic valves are closed with a separate, dedicated
  cam lobe and lifter instead of the conventional valve springs used in most internal combustion engines in consumer vehicles. This allows the cams to have a more
  radical profile, thus opening and closing the valves more quickly without the risk of valve-float, which causes a loss of power that is likely when using a "passive"
  closing mechanism under the same conditions.While most other manufacturers use wet clutches (with the spinning parts bathed in oil)[16] Ducati previously used multiplate
  dry clutches in many of their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the power loss from oil viscosity drag on the engine, even though the engagement may not be as smooth
  as the oil-bath versions, but the clutch plates can wear more rapidly. Ducati has converted to wet clutches across their current product lines.
 Ducati also extensively uses a trellis frame, although Ducati's MotoGP project broke with this tradition by introducing a revolutionary carbon fibre frame for the Ducati Desmosedici GP9.</strong></p>

       the successor to the V-twin engined 1299. A smaller engine displacement version complies with the Superbike category competition regulations
      which state "Over 750 cc up to 1000 cc" for three and four cylinder 4-stroke engines.The name "Panigale" comes from the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale.
     The Panigale V4 uses the new Desmosedici Stradale V4 engine, derived from the Desmosedici MotoGP racing engine.</th>
